16. Question:
You have two tables:
• Orders with columns: order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount.
• Customers with columns: customer_id, region.
• O/P- region | total_orders
Write an SQL query to find the total order amount (total_amount) for each region. Only include regions where the total order amount is greater than 10000
-> select region, sum(total_amount) from
customer c inner join orders o
on c.customer_id= o.customer_id
group by region
having sum(total_amount)>10000;

17. Question:
You have two tables:
• Books with columns: book_id, author_id, title, price.
• Sales with columns: sale_id, book_id, sale_date, quantity.
• O/P- author_id | total_books_sold

Write an SQL query to find the total number of books sold by each author. Only include authors who have sold more than 100 books.
-> select author_id, sum(quantity) from 
books b inner join sales s
on b.book_id=s.book_id
